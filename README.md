# Project Overview

**MindMemos** is a peer‑support mental health journaling app. Users can write public journal entries about what they are experiencing (e.g., *panic attacks*), read others’ posts, and learn coping tips from people who have been through similar situations. Topic‑based chat rooms enable real‑time conversations, while search helps users discover related posts and discussions. An upvote/token system highlights posts that have helped others. *(This app is for peer support and is not a substitute for professional care.)*
